      <p>
        Unless otherwise stated in writing, work with LumenNyx Studios is performed as an independent contractor,

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>9. Takedown Requests</h2>
      <p>
        The studio may, at its discretion, honor requests to limit or remove content from its own platforms.
        However, once adult content is published online, complete removal from third-party platforms may not be possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Release/takedown-related requests should be directed to
        <a href="mailto:<%= emailRelease %>"><strong><%= emailRelease %></strong></a>.

      <p>
        You may request account closure at any time. The studio may suspend or deactivate accounts for security, misuse,
        or policy violations. Required compliance records and releases may still be retained as required by law.
