      <p>

      <p class="hero-note">
        This site is a private portal for models and approved collaborators.
        It is not a public video platform.

    <!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
    <section class="legal-section">
      <h3>How the Portal Works</h3>
      <p>
        The LumenNyx portal is where models and studio collaborators can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain accurate legal identity and contact details.</li>
        <li>Upload ID, W-9, and other compliance documents securely.</li>
        <li>Review and sign a general / master model release.</li>
        <li>Set and update safety, consent, and hard/soft limits.</li>
        <li>Share headshots or portfolio photos for internal casting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="field-help">
        All information in the portal is used for studio record-keeping, scheduling,
        and safety planning. It is not shared publicly.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CONSENT & SAFETY PHILOSOPHY -->
    <section class="legal-section">
      <h3>Consent, Safety & Respect</h3>
      <p>
        LumenNyx Studios operates on a strict consent-first approach. This means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clear boundaries and hard limits are discussed and documented before shooting.</li>
        <li>No illegal drugs or performing while impaired by alcohol on set.</li>
        <li>Safe words / stop signals are respected immediately.</li>
        <li>Models can ask for breaks or stop a scene at any time.</li>
        <li>Concerns about behavior or boundaries are taken seriously.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="field-help">
        The portal’s consent section is not a contract by itself – it’s a practical tool
        to keep everyone aligned and safe. You should always feel free to raise questions
        or concerns directly with the studio.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- LEGAL / 18+ NOTE -->
    <section class="legal-section">
      <h3>Legal & Age Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        All performers must be at least 18 years old and provide valid government-issued
        photo ID before any adult content is created. The studio maintains internal
        records for age verification and applicable federal / New York compliance
        obligations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information on this site is for general orientation and record-keeping only
        and is not individual legal advice. Performers are encouraged to consult their
        own attorney about contracts, rights, and long-term implications of adult work.
